The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world’s most beloved brands – customer obsession is part of our company DNA. Our interns write real software and collaborate with experienced software development engineers (SDEs) who guide interns on projects that matter to our customers. Key job responsibilities • Design, implement and deliver state-of-the-art distributed, high-performance data and transaction management processing algorithms and solutions. • Deploy and monitor new features in a highly available and fault tolerant system running in the cloud. A day in the life As an intern, you will be matched to a manager and a mentor. You will have the opportunity to influence the evolution of Amazon technology and lead mission critical projects early in your career.

No matter the location of your internship, we give you the tools to own your project and learn in a real-world setting.
